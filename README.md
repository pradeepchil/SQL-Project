# SQL-Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL Server analytics workflow where raw export transaction data is transformed into a clean, business-ready analytical view using SQL.

The goal of this project is to prepare a reporting-friendly dataset that can be directly consumed by BI tools such as Power BI.
